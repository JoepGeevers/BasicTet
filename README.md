For many years I have had this on my todo list: Writing Tetris for the Commodore 64, in BASIC.

At first, I didn't have the skill to do it. And when I did, I thought I didn't have the time.

Two days ago, while showering, I just randomly started chopping the game up, and surprisingly few bits and pieces remained, so I started. And here it is.

Not optimized! At all! It runs really really slow. Maybe I will care enough one day to speed it up, either by optimizing BASIC, or by replacing slow algorithms with machine language. Maybe I won't

The hardest part was actually returning to BASIC V2. Line numbers. No `else` statement. No scoped variables. No debugging. Terrifying really.

But I love it
